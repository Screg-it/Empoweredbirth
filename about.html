      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Scarlett Garcia hosts The Empowered Birth Podcast, a space built for women who want clarity, confidence and a sense of control as they move through pregnancy and birth.
She shares stories, conversations and practical insights that make the whole experience feel a little less overwhelming and a lot more supported.

This site is where everything lives in one place, the episodes, the background, and the heart behind it all. Simple and honest, just like the conversations she has each week.</p>
